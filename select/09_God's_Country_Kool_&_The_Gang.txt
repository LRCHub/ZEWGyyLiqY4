Travelling travelling travelling
Over God's country

We have been blessed
With the one more tomorrow
To make our dreams come true
So let's take this time
Before time passes by to make real our fantasy
There's a place I love and often dream of
Like a painted picture
It so beautiful

Late at night when all the stars are shining
It so lovely to see
Would you like to go with me?

Travelling
Over God's country
You and me
Travelling me and you
Together
Travelling
Over God's country

You always wanted to fly like the wind
To the place where we first began
To the east in the morning light
We'll ride into paradise

Travelling travelling travelling
Over God's Country you and me
Travelling you and me
Travelling travelling
Over God's Country you and me
Over God's Country

Love is our guide as we take to the sky
To the land of majesty
The love everywhere because people do care
What a lovely sight to see

God's country to the land of milk and honey
What can you do
God's country there you're sure to find (there no more time)
