The road is longer than it is hard
With no one to guide you
And no one to hold
No best foot forward to sway the odds
Just a voice inside you
And a stone to throw
Could you be someone else
If someone else is what I need
But I shouldn't ask that of you
When you're old you'll understand
But we're hurting now so what are we to do 'til then
Cradling pictures of you
It was a highway to nowhere, and we rode it
Cold car with no gas and we chose it
Soft bodies playing in the street
Our kids will grow up with half as much
Trying to build something out of dust
Finding out too late what they need
You've tasted loved and it tasted sweet
You drank the blood and bit the meat
You hold it, you hold it, you let it go
You close your eyes and count to three
You say the word and come to me
And baby, I know
Drive the pathway through the pines
And the moors of mystery
Welcome conflict and let crisis come and shake the ground beneath
And the family secret hiding
In the farmhouse down the street
Rushes open door on your front porch
And shadows me
Taken and entirely I embraced the bonny beast
Over hills and highlands we rode hard the passing peaks
Danger liked the virgin wife beside me she would sleep
Cherry was her dad's truck that she crashed at seventeen
I kneel before what temper broke the branches on the beach
And those thrilling highs and southern nights are always out of reach
I learned a lesson
I need to pray and hard
Final hours, take care of me god (take care of me god)
You've tasted loved and it tasted sweet
You drank the blood and bit the meat
You hold it, you hold it, you let it go
You close your eyes and count to three
You say the word and come to me
Baby, I know
The road is longer than it is hard
(Love overwhelms me)
With no one to guide you
(It's all that I want, and it's all that we have)
No best foot forward to sway the odds
(But is it enough)
Just a voice inside you
(To make it worth it in the end)
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
Don't sink in me
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
You've tasted love and it tasted sweet
You drank the blood and bit the meat
You hold it, you hold it, but you'll never know
You close your eyes and cry to me
Don't sink in me with your dog teeth
We're better off if you let go
In god's country
In god's country
If it was harder then
It will be better now
For I am here and changed
I couldn't tell you how
There before the grace of god go I
Laughing to myself
Forgetting what about
